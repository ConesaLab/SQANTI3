	TRANSCRIPT-LEVEL SUMMARY

		·A total of 0.00 % of transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (0 of 3925) were annotated because they matched a transcript ID in the GFF3 source annotation file (SQANTI FSM and ISM).
		·A total of 39.49 % of transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (1550 of 3925) were not annotated because reference has no annotations.
		·A total of 0.00 % of transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (0 of 3925) were not annotated by positional feature transference.

		·A total of 60.51 % of transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (2375 of 3925) do not match any of the transcript IDs in the GFF3 file (SQANTI novel transcripts).
			·A total of 0.00 % novel transcripts (0 of 3925) were annotated by positional feature transference.
			·A total of 0.00 % of novel transcripts (0 of 3925) were not annotated by any positional feature.
			·A total of 0.00 % of novel transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (0 of 3925) were not annotated because no gene name was returned by SQANTI output.
			·A total of 60.51 % of novel transcripts in the GTF target annotation file (2375 of 3925) were not annotated because gene ID was not found in GFF3 source annotation file.
