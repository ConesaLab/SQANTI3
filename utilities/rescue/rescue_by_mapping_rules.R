# DESCRIPTION:
# This script contains the code for the third module of the SQANTI3 rescue
# pipeline, which integrates rescue candidate alignment results (to their same-gene
# counterparts, both from the reference and from the long read defined transcriptome). 
# Using the rules filter results obtained for all rescue targets (both reference 
# and long read-defined transcripts), it selects the best rescue target from 
# those that were retrieved during alignment.
