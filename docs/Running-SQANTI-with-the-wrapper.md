# SQANTI3 wrapper

In order to run the whole pipeline, or just some part of it, through the command line, it can be directly run using `sqanti3 <module>` and a configuration file. The configuration file can be created by running the `init` module. This will create the default empty file `sqanti3_config.yaml`. This configuration file is fundamental for running the workflow.
